## What is Dynamic Programming ?
##### Dynamic Programming is an enhanced recursion.
#### How to know which question will be solved by Dynamic Programming ?
##### DP will be applied to a question 
1. If the question is choice based, like whether a particular element should be included or not, 
2. If the question is asking to find optimal values like minimum, maximum or largest, etc.
